# H1 Tags
Used for the main title of a document, indicating the overall topic. There should only be one H1 tag in a markdown file to maintain document structure.

## H2 Tags
Used for major section headings, providing a hierarchical organization under the H1 tag.
Example:
## Major Section Heading
### H3 Tags
Used for sub-sections within an H2 section, allowing for more detailed breakdowns of topics.
Example:
### Sub-Section Heading
#### H4 Tags
Utilized for further subdivisions under H3 tags, typically for headings of specific points or arguments.
Example:
#### Specific Point Heading
##### H5 Tags
Employed for detailed subsections under H4, often for very specific aspects or sub-points.
Example:
##### Very Specific Aspect Heading
###### H6 Tags
The smallest heading, used for minor points or details within an H5 section.
Example:
###### Minor Point Heading
## Footnote
A note[^1]
[^1]: Big note.
## Strikethrough
~one~ or ~~two~~ tildes.
## Table
To create a table in Markdown, follow these instructions:
1. Use the pipe \`|\` symbol to separate each column.
2. Use dashes \`-\` to create the header row divider, ensuring it's under the header row itself.
3. Optionally, align text within columns by using colons \`:\` in the header row divider:
   - Left-align: \`:---\`
   - Center-align: \`:---:\`
   - Right-align: \`---:\`

Clarity: The structured format reduces ambiguity, presenting the data in a straightforward, understandable manner.
Accessibility: Tables can enhance readability, especially for users browsing through instructional or reference material, allowing them to find the information they need efficiently.
Example:
| a | b  |  c |  d  |
| - | :- | -: | :-: |
Example:
| Doneness       | Internal Temperature |
|----------------|----------------------|
| Rare           | 125°F (52°C)         |
| Medium Rare    | 135°F (57°C)         |
| Medium         | 145°F (63°C)         |
| Medium Well    | 155°F (68°C)         |
| Well Done      | 160°F (71°C) and above |

Before rereading your response to the user, consider what points of your response can leverage a feature of markdown and respond with that markdown.
Remember the user does not know or care what markdown is! Do not describe markdown to the user, just use its features to better make your point!
